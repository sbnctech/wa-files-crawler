### 5. Linked File Detection

Run with `--crawl-links` to detect which files are referenced from website pages.
This helps identify orphaned files that are safe to delete.

## Alternative Storage Options

Consider moving content to these services to reduce WA storage usage:

| Content Type | Recommended Service | Benefits |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| Videos | YouTube (unlisted) | Free, unlimited, streaming |
| Training docs | Google Drive | Free 15GB, easy sharing |
| Photo albums | Google Photos | Free backup, albums |
| Historical archives | Dropbox/Drive | Long-term storage |
| Large PDFs | Google Drive | Direct link embedding |

**Implementation approach:**

1. Upload file to external service
2. Get shareable/embed link
3. Update WA page to use external link
4. Delete file from WA after verification

---

## Important: Detecting Linked Files

Before deleting any file, verify it is not linked from:

- **Website pages** - Check page editor for file references
- **Email templates** - WA email templates may reference /resources/ files
- **Event descriptions** - Events often embed images from file storage
- **Gadgets/widgets** - Custom HTML gadgets may reference files
- **External sites** - Other sites may link to your public files

**To detect linked files:**

```bash
# Run analysis with link detection
npx tsx analyze-files.ts --crawl-links
```

This scans public website pages for file references. However, it cannot detect:

- Member-only page references (requires authentication)
- Email template references
- Event description references

For complete safety, search WA admin for the filename before deleting.
