## Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Est. savings: 150+ MB)

1. **Delete Archive folders** after confirming contents are not needed:
   - Documents/Training Guides/Archives/
   - Documents/Member Information/Old files/
   - Documents/Job Descriptions/Old Job Descriptions/

2. **Review ZZZ-prefixed folders** - naming suggests obsolete:
   - Pictures/ZZZ-Site page Images and Pictures/
   - Pictures/ZZZ-Page templates images/

### Phase 2: Video Migration (Est. savings: 150 MB)

1. Upload training videos to YouTube (unlisted or club channel)
2. Replace video files with links in WA
3. Delete original video files

### Phase 3: Document Optimization

1. Review 38 MB "Registering for an Event" doc - likely needs image optimization
2. Check other large .docx files for embedded image bloat
3. Consider converting old .doc files to .pdf

### Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance

1. Establish naming convention (avoid date suffixes when possible)
2. Create cleanup schedule (annual review of Archives)
3. Set up image size guidelines for uploads

1. Are the ZZZ-prefixed folders still in use on the website?
2. Which training videos are still current vs. outdated?
3. Is there a YouTube channel for hosting club videos?
4. Who should review Archive folders before deletion?
